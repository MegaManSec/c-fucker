The idea of this program is to see what happens when a C program's `main()` function does nothing, and the rest of the functionality is handled in `__attribute__ ((constructor))` functions.

The whole C program is converted to one function which calls itself `main3()->main2()->main2()->main2()->main2()->...` with different parameters referring to if-blocks, to emulate a single-function.

`intmax_t` type is used so promotion is possible in nearly all cases. float/double functions do not work in this case, however.

The idea is to see what happens to decompilers in this case, and if it makes reverse-engineering more difficult to read.

In at least the case of `tiny` in examples/, Ghidra crashes on https://dogbolt.org/.

Full README will come eventually.

Take a look at the `only-main` branch for a 100% `main()`-only implementation.
